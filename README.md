  ## Description:
  This project was designed in order to utilize node.js in order to generate an html page populated with team profile cards filled with information gathered through user input after answering a series of prompts.  The website generated should display summaries for each person and contain links to their email and github pages.  Test driven development is also a part of this project due to the fact that passing tests should be present as well as the npm program jest.  
  ## Installation:
  Installation requirements include: node.js and npm installations of inquirer and jest
  ## Usage:
  After cloning the repository from the github page, install the npm packages and then run the inquirer prompt by typing node index.js into the terminal.
